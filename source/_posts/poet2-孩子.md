# 孩子

你的孩子，并不是你的孩子
他们是由生命本身的渴望而诞生的孩子
他们借助你来到这个世界，却非因你而来
他们在你身旁，却并不属于你
<!-- more -->

你可以给予他们的是你的爱，而不是你的想法
因为他们有自己的思想
你可以庇护的是他们的身体，而不是他们的灵魂
因为他们的灵魂属于明天，属于你做梦也无法到达的明天
你可以拼尽全力，变得像他们一样，却不要他们变得和你一样
因为生命不会后退，也不会在过去停留

你是弓，儿女是从你那里射出的箭
弓箭手望着未来之路上的箭靶，他用尽气力将弓拉开，使他的箭射得又快又远
怀着快乐的心情，在弓箭手的手中弯曲吧
因为他一路飞翔的箭，也爱无比稳定的弓。

## 原文

> Your children are not your children.
> They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.
> They come through you, yet they belong not to you.
> You may give them your love but not your thoughts.
> For they have their own thoughts.
> You may house their bodies but not their souls.
> For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.
> You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.
> For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.
> 
> You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.
> The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and he bends you with his might that his 
> arrows may go swift and far.
> Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness; For even as he loves the arrow that files, 
> so he loves also the bow that is stable.
